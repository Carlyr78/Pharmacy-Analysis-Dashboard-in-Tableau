Pharmacy Analysis Dashboard

Overview

This repository hosts a delivery frequency analysis dashboard created using Tableau. The dashboard is designed to help identify customers who receive a high number of deliveries, particularly focusing on those who may be receiving more shipments than necessary. As a pharmacy offering free shipping, optimizing delivery frequency is crucial for managing costs effectively while maintaining customer satisfaction.

Features

1. Delivery Frequency Analysis
The dashboard provides visualizations to identify customers who receive multiple deliveries within a month. By analyzing delivery frequency, we can pinpoint customers who may require interventions to optimize their shipment schedules and reduce unnecessary deliveries.

2. Average Margin and Percentage of Business by Plan
In addition to delivery frequency analysis, the dashboard includes visual representations of average margin and percentage of business for each plan. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of profitability and market share across different customer segments.

3. Margin Analysis by Zipcode
Detailed margin analysis based on zip codes is provided to understand geographical variations in profitability. A density map visualizes these figures, helping to prioritize cost-saving measures in areas with lower margins.


Data Sources

The dashboard utilizes data from our pharmacy database, including transactional information, customer details, and geographic data such as zip codes. Due to the maintaining customer privacy, any identifying information has been blurred.
